This repo is created for blog tutorial: 
https://community.ops.io/nurulramadhona/a-simple-idea-to-learn-ci-for-beginner-2ipj

GitLab: 
https://gitlab.com/nurulramadhona/learn-ci

Docker image: 
https://hub.docker.com/layers/nurulramadhona/httpd/github/images/sha256-09860b29e1644d4ecbc8ce61364c40dda0e9e16e0c1ad1eb77ab8b80b453b165?context=repo

Note: 
Since this is new repo and the docker image already exists, I change tag or version of docker image from "github" to "github-test". This is not a big deal, then it should work on your side whatever the name.
